# Self-Stabilizing-Stable-Marriage-Simulation
The simulation code for the distributed stable marriage algorithm I developed during study abroad.

To run the test code, import src into any Java IDE and run SimuClass.java.
Promts will explain the rest.

For explanatory pseudocode of the real distributed version check out Pseudo-Code.pdf
For proof of the algorithm's complexity and completeness check out part four of Uncoordinated Two-Sided Matching Markets.pdf

For note, the pseudoCode and simulation were written by Chris Sisemore, the paper was not.
